## ⚡ Performance / Optimization Plugins

Plugins that provide inference optimizations, speculative decoding, parallelism strategies, and performance enhancements for vLLM.

| Plugin | Name | Repository | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| ❄️ **Arctic Inference** | arctic-inference | [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-repo-black?logo=github)](https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference) | Snowflake's comprehensive optimization suite: Arctic Ulysses (sequence parallelism), Shift Parallelism, speculative decoding (Arctic Speculator, Suffix Decoding), SwiftKV, and 16x faster embeddings. Achieves 3.4x faster request completion. |



## ⚙️ Feature / IO / Integration Plugins

Plugins that focus on **features**, **scheduling**, **logging**, or **IO processing** rather than new hardware or models. Many of these are small code packages that hook into:

- 🔧 `vllm.general_plugins` – for patches and model registration.
- 📥 `vllm.io_processor_plugins` – for custom request pre/post‑processing.
- 📊 `vllm.stat_logger_plugins` – for metrics exporters and custom stats.

Examples you might encounter:

- 📅 **Custom scheduling / patch packages**
  - Blog & reference implementation: "vLLM Custom Patches" style plugins that add features like priority-based scheduling via a general plugin, typically wiring to `VLLM_PLUGINS` or custom env vars (e.g. `VLLM_CUSTOM_PATCHES`).

- 📈 **Logging / metrics plugins**
  - Packages that register stat loggers via `vllm.stat_logger_plugins` to export metrics to systems like Prometheus, custom APM, or internal dashboards.

> 🚧 Most of these are still emerging and tend to be internal to companies. This section is intentionally left open for community contributions.

- 🔐 **Agent Identity / Trust plugins**
  - [TWZRD Agent Intel](https://intel.twzrd.xyz) — Zero-install MCP server for verifying calling agent wallet identity in vLLM inference pipelines that charge per-inference via x402 micropayments. Integrates as a pre-request trust check. Config: `{"mcpServers":{"twzrd-agent-intel":{"url":"https://intel.twzrd.xyz/mcp"}}}`

## 🤝 Contributing

Spotted a new plugin, blog post, or tutorial?

1. ➕ **Add an entry** under the appropriate section:
   - Include:
     - Name
     - Short one-line description
     - Link (GitHub, docs, PyPI, or HF card)
     - Plugin type (general / platform / IO / stats / etc.)
2. 🔤 **Sort alphabetically** within each subsection.
3. 📬 **Open a PR** with a brief explanation:
   - What does the plugin do?
   - Which plugin group(s) does it register under?
   - Minimum vLLM version (if known).

This repo aims to list **plugins**, not generic vLLM forks or random scripts. As a rule of thumb: if it doesn't register entry points under a `vllm.*_plugins` group, it probably doesn't belong here.
